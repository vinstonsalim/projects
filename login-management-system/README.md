# Introduction

This is a complex login management system that mainly uses the php language. In this project I focused on the backend and the security of the system. The frontend is very simple and basic with Bootstrap. The system is based on the MVC architecture with the repository pattern.

For reference I used the following tutorial: [PHP Login System Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw5HB2IwNAA&pp=ygUecHJvZ3JhbWVyIHRhbWFuIG5vdyBwaHAgbG9naW4g)
