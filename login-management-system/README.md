# Introduction

This is a complex login management system that mainly uses the PHP language. In this project I focused on the backend and the security of the system also things like design pattern e.g repository pattern and dependency injection. The frontend is very simple and basic with Bootstrap.

For reference I used the following tutorial: [PHP Login System Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw5HB2IwNAA&pp=ygUecHJvZ3JhbWVyIHRhbWFuIG5vdyBwaHAgbG9naW4g)
